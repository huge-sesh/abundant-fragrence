1 weird trick to animate an os x desktop
todo: fix the config sheet, 3-image dissolve, make it use less cpu, make it less than impossible to use
start it off by installing it like a screensaver, pick a folder with images in it in the screen saver config, then
/System/Library/Frameworks/ScreenSaver.framework/Resources/ScreenSaverEngine.app/Contents/MacOS/ScreenSaverEngine -background
try the included 'clouds' and 'clocks' as loops
